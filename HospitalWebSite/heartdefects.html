As specialists in congenital heart disease, pediatric cardiologists have the expertise to coordinate a multidisciplinary approach in providing high quality patient care to adults with congenital heart disease. This multidisciplinary approach includes the close involvement of the pediatric cardiologist with primary care physicians, adult cardiology, high-risk obstetrics, social work, interventional cardiology and the congenital cardiovascular surgeons. Specific issues arising in adults with congenital heart disease include heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, pregnancy, residual congenital defects, coronary artery disease and complex heart rhythm disorders. Our ability to maintain normal quality and length of life is continually improving. Our goal is to offer state of the art care throughout the lives of these patients.

Some patients will be seen in EP clinic from the beginning, while others start in general cardiology clinic and then are referred to EP clinic when their symptoms turn out to be related to a heart rhythm problem.  Common conditions treated include Coronary artery and cacular disease, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and heart block.  Important but rare conditions treated include life-threatening rhythm problems such as Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD), Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome, Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/Cardiomyopathy (ARVD/ARVC), and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT).  For patients with a family history of one of these conditions, please try to bring any records (genetic testing, autopsy results) to the first visit. <br>Device clinic (sometimes called Pacemaker Clinic) is dedicated to the care of patients needing pacemakers and defibrillators (ICDs).  In these visits, the permanently implanted devices are checked and reprogrammed using special equipment.  Sometimes this care can be provided directly from the patient’s home using special wireless equipment to transmit data from the device directly to our hospital computers.

			<td style="background-color:#2BD3D3;";><p>At the Children's Heart Center of New Life Hospital, pregnant mothers at risk of bearing a child with congenital heart disease are evaluated by a pediatric cardiologist with extensive experience in the diagnosis and management of fetal heart disease. An onsite Pediatric Echocardiography Lab enables the unborn child to benefit from the most advanced technology currently available. Other problems, such as abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure, may be evaluated and treated. Once identified the mother and fetus are treated as a single patient and may be followed for the rest of the pregnancy by the Fetal Cardiology Team if needed. The team includes the pediatric cardiologist, advanced practice nurse and social worker. The pregnancy is discussed in detail with perinatology, neonatology and, if necessary, pediatric cardiothoracic surgery. Delivery is planned in conjunction with these groups.

			<br><b>Pregnant mothers are most often referred to the Fetal Cardiology Program by their obstetricians when:</b>
				<ul>

					<li>They are considered to be at risk of having a child with a congenital heart disease</li>
					<li>If there is a specific concern about the fetus based on a screening obstetric ultrasound.</li>
				</ul>
				An appointment can then be made by calling our fetal echocardiography office at 011-2635981. The mother will be asked some specific questions about the pregnancy and information about her obstetrician and pediatrician. Once at the visit, the test is performed in a quiet room where there is plenty of space for the father and other family members to attend, if desired. After completion, the results are reviewed and diagrams are provided. There is ample opportunity for questions at that time and counseling is given as needed. Results are sent to both the mother's obstetrician and the child's pediatrician. The total visit can be expected to take between 45 minutes and 1½ hrs
