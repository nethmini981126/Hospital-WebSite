<p>Tooth decay and periodontal disease are the most common causes of tooth loss. Tooth decay takes place when most of the tooth’s mineral makeup has been dissolved away and a hole (cavity) has formed. While tooth decay primarily affects children, periodontal disease, or gum disease, affects mostly adults. Periodontal disease is an infection of the gums caused by the buildup of plaque, and its earliest stage is known as gingivitis.</p>

Though an extraction is cheaper, an implant or a bridge to replace the tooth can be more expensive than root canal therapy. If you have a choice, it is always advisable to keep your original teeth.
