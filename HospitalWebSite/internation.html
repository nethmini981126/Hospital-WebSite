<div class="content">
  <p>Climatically speaking, the driest (and the best) seasons in Sri Lanka are from December to March for hill country and from April to September to visit the ancient cities. December through March most tourists visit Sri Lanka, to escape winter. July/August is the time of the Kandy Perahera, the 10-day festival honouring the sacred tooth relic of the Buddha, and also the time for the Kataragama festival in the South. Sri Lanka’s climate means that it is always the right beach season.</p>
