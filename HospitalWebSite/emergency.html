<button class="accordion">Hospital Emergancy Departments</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> <b>The emergency departments of New Life hospitals</b> received more than 8 million visits in the 2017 / 2018 financial year. About 1 in 3 patients were admitted to hospital. This page tells you what to expect if you go to an emergency department, or ED.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<button class="accordion">What is an Emergancy Department (ED)?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>EDs are hospital units where you can seek urgent medical care and treatment. Most major public hospital EDs are open 24 hours a day and have highly trained doctors and other health professionals on site to deal with emergencies.</p>

<p>They assess, treat, stabilise and start the health management of people who have come to the ED with a serious illness or injury.  </p>

<p>Some emergency departments specialise: there are emergency department attached to children’s hospitals, some women’s hospitals and some eye or ear hospitals. Most EDs, however, accept all emergencies.</p>

<p>To find your closest emergency department, visit healthdirect’s online service finder.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<button class="accordion">When and why should you visit an ED?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You should go to a hospital ED if you or your child are seriously ill or injured.

People often take babies or children to public hospital EDs if they become ill suddenly. Many older people go there for urgent attention too.

Most people go to EDs with types of condition that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Injuries from accidents, physical assaults or falls</li>
<li>Heart attack and stroke</li>
<li>Severe pain</li>
<li>Problems with breathing or bleeding</li>
<li>Broken bones</li>
<li>Loss of consciousness</li>
<li>Worsening of a serious illness</li>
<li>Drug overdoses or poisoning</li>
<li>Allergic reactions</li>
<li>Pregnancy complications</li>
<li>Mental illness</li>
<li>Burns</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br><br>
<button class="accordion">What happens first when you visit an Ed?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When you go to an ED, the first step is usually for an administrative staff member to get your name, address and Medicare number. This is important to make sure that you receive the treatment you need, and to avoid confusing your healthcare management with anybody else’s.

This step is bypassed in an emergency.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<button class="accordion">The triage nurse</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>All EDs use a system of triage (pronounced tree-arge), which is designed to ensure the people who need help most urgently are treated first. You will generally see a triage nurse after your name, address and Medicare number have been taken.</p>

	<p>The triage nurse will talk to you and might examine you, and will then place you in 1 of 5 categories:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Resuscitation - needs treatment immediately</li>
		<li>Emergancy - needs treatment within 10 minutes</li>
		<li>Urgent - needs treatment within 30 minutes</li>
		<li>Semi-urgent  - needs treatment within 1 hour</li>
		<li>Non-urgent - needs treatment within 2 hours</li>
		
	</ul>
	<img src="triage.jpg">
</div>
<br><br>
<button class="accordion">The ED doctor</button>
<div class="panel">
  
<p>In time, you will be seen by a doctor or specialist in a private area. They will talk to you and examine you to assess your condition and decide what treatment or medication is needed. The doctor may order blood tests, x-rays, scans or other tests.</p>

<p>This step, too, can be bypassed in an emergency.</p>

<p>In some cases, emergency departments use highly qualified nurses and specialist allied health teams instead of, or to support, doctors.</p>

<p>You might be asked to see a social worker or other doctors or specialist nurses. The doctor might also recommend that you be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Admitted to hospital</li>
	<li>Observed and treated but remain in ED for the moment</li>
	<li>Treated with stitches, dressings, a plaster cast or that you have surgery</li>
	<li>Prescribed medicine</li>
	<li>Discharged for follow-up by your general practitioner(GP)</li>
	<li>Referred to a specialist or outpatient clinic</li>
	<li>Transferred to another hospital for treatment</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br><br>
<button class="accordion">What should you obtain before being discharged?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Before you are discharged from hospital, ask for:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Details of your health condition, injury etc.</li>
	<li>Information about any treatment given, whether it should continue once you leave; and how this will be arranged</li>
	<li>Information about what to expect when you leave, and what to do next</li>
	<li>A letter for your doctor(general practitioner, or GP)</li>
	<li>A letter for Work Cover or a medical certificate, if appropriate.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<br><br>
<button class="accordion">What is the cost of visiting an ED?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Visits to public hospital EDs are free for Every one. You may be charged if you go to a private hospital emergency department. But we provide good service for all comers. We will charge you a reasonable fee for the service you receive from us.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<button class="accordion">Alternatives to an ED</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>If you have a minor illness or injury that does not need emergency treatment, you can ask for an appointment with your GP during regular hours, or visit an after-hours medical centre.</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Asking an after-hours doctor to visit your home</li>
	<li>calling New life hospital on 0112635981 or 0112635982 for advice from a registered nurse of New Life Hospital.</li>
	<li>calling a mental health counselling service of New Life hospital for advice</li>
  </ul>
